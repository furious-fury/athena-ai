        // For MVP: assume signal direction aligns with "YES" if Question is positive?
        // Let's trust "outcome" in signal? No, signal gives BULLISH/BEARISH.

        // Let's assume the LLM analysis aligns with the market question if we passed the market to LLM.
        // BUT we are doing search AFTER LLM.
        // So we have a mismatch risk: Signal "Bitcoin Bullish" vs Market "Will Bitcoin crash?"

        // ALTERNATIVE: AgentLoop does the validation. SignalProcessor just candidates?
        // The plan says "Signal Processor runs EV calc".

        // Let's implement a straightforward EV based on "Confidence" provided by AI,
        // assuming AI's confidence map to "Outcome YES".
        // To do this properly, we really need the LLM to look at the market question.
        // Refinement: SignalProcessor should maybe ask LLM "Does this market match the signal?"
        // Or we stick to strict keyword matching.

        // Let's return the opportunity with raw data, and let AgentLoop doing the final Decision (which calls LLM again with specific market context) decide the exact Outcome.
        // So here we just rank by "Potential".

        // Actually, the new loop design:
        // 1. News -> Signal
        // 2. Signal -> Search Markets
        // 3. Agent analyses SPECIFIC MARKET in `tick()` using full context.

        // So SignalProcessor just needs to find CANDIDATE markets.
