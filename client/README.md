- `src/components`: Reusable UI components and feature-specific blocks (AgentControl, MarketExplorer, etc.).
- `src/pages`: Main application views.
- `src/hooks`: Custom React hooks (Web3 integration, API fetchers).
- `src/context`: React Context providers.
- `src/lib`: Utility functions and API clients.

## 🔌 API Connection

The client connects to the **Athena AI Server** (usually running on port 5000). Ensure the backend server is running for full functionality including:

- Historical Data

## 📦 Build for Production

To create a production-ready build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile the application into the `dist` directory, ready to be deployed to any static site host (Vercel, Netlify, S3, etc.).
